# AI Pose Correction for Influencers

## Overview
Welcome to the AI Pose Correction for Influencers repository! This project is dedicated to developing advanced machine learning models aimed at analyzing the postures of influencers in images to ensure they are ergonomically correct and visually appealing. Our goal is to create an AI tool that assists influencers in maintaining a proper posture, thereby enhancing their presence and engagement on social media platforms.

## Features
- **Posture Analysis:** Utilize AI to detect postures and suggest improvements.
- **Model Training:** Frameworks for training custom models on posture data.
- **Image Processing:** Automated pipelines to preprocess and filter images for analysis.
- **Visualization:** Tools for visualizing posture analytics and corrections.
- **User Interface:** A simple UI for influencers to upload images and receive feedback.
